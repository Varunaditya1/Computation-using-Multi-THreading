# These are the steps of execution to be followed (make sure you are in a Linux machine):

For the compilation of the code, Enter the input line similar to the one below (check if you are operating in the same directory as the code):-

1) gcc Assgn2Src-MA20BTECH11021.c -o Assgn2Src-MA20BTECH11021

This line will compile the program code and and will create an executable file named Assgn2Src-MA20BTECH11021.

The executable has to be run now:-

2) ./Assgn2Src-MA20BTECH11021

This will execute the program, while reading the input from "input.txt" and generating the OutFile_i's for each thread and 1 MainOut file containing the resultant Perfect No's.
